// CAUTION!
// The Conditional Access API has compatibility issues between API versions. If you create a policy using the Beta API,
// or even if you update an existing policy using the Beta API that was originally created with the Stable API, that
// policy will be irrevocably mutated and can no longer be updated, or even _read_ using the Stable API.
// For this reason, we are bound to using the Stable API here, as to use the Beta API, even to update a single property
// for a Conditional Access Policy, will break that policy for users. The only way to go back to the Stable API after
// breaking a policy in this way, is to delete and recreate it, which is wholly undesirable for a critical security resource.
